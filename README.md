# bb-threejs-starter
starter kit for quick deal with `three.js`
main features:
* `typescript`
* `ES8`/`ES2017` features are fully acceptable
* `webpack` with environments: `development`, `production`, `test`
  * ...though tests instruments (`karna`, `mocha`, `sinon`...) are most likely useless here, so might be removed
* `webpack-bundle-analyzer`
* `eslint`
